The data set contains more than 13,000 images of faces collected from the web. Each face has been labeled with the name of the person pictured. 1680 of the people pictured have two or more distinct photos in the data set. The only constraint on these faces is that they were detected by the Viola-Jones face detector. More details can be found in the technical report below.**\r\n\r\n  ** FDDB represents Face Detection Data Set and Benchmark,which is hold by Massachusetts Institute of Technology，a data set of face regions designed for studying the problem of unconstrained face detection. This data set contains the anotations for 5171 faces in a set of 2845 images taken from the Faces in the Wild data set. More details can be found in the technical report below. **\r\n\r\n### Copy Right\r\n   This Page's mainly is to show Wang Sheng(王胜 武汉科技大学)'s result of LFW and FDDB,and give some code of it.\r\n\r\n   FDDB全称Face Detection Data Set and Benchmark，是由马萨诸塞大学计算机系维护的一套公开数据库，为来自全世界的研究者提供一个标准的人脸检测评测平台，其中涵盖在自然环境下的各种姿态的人脸；该校还维护了LFW等知名人脸数据库供研究者做人脸识别的研究。作为全世界最具权威的人脸检测评测平台之一，FDDB使用Faces in the Wild数据库中的包含5171张人脸的2845张图片作为测试集，而其公布的评测集也代表了人脸检测的世界最高水平。\r\n   \r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
